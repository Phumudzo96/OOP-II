# OOP-II

Using the Lion class template, as shown in this pdf ﬁle, expand the class to
have features speciﬁc to a lion:

        ○ Add a ﬁeld for lion type (cub, male, female).

        ○ Add a method in this class which sets the lion type based on its
        weight (note that the weight is a derived ﬁeld f rom the superclass).

        ○ If the weight is less than 80kg, it’s type should be a cub. If less than
        120kg, it should be female. If greater than 120kg, it is a male.

        ○ Include a method that will print out a description of a lion object.

Create a class called ‘Cheetah’ that:

        ○ Inherits f rom the Animal class.

        ○ Makes use of at least one static ﬁeld which needs to have a static
        setter and getter.

        ○ Contains a constructor.

        ○ Contains a toString() method.

        ○ Has an array as one of its ﬁelds.

Create an application class. Within the main method, create a Cheetah
object and print it out the details that describe this object.

Compile, save and run your ﬁle.
